DSSBingo is a fabric version of my interpretation of minecraft bingo intended to be able to run as a server side only mod where vanilla clients can join and play.

## Installation
For installation instructions see: [Server](https://github.com/Encrypted-Thoughts/DidSomeoneSayBingo/wiki/Installation#server) or [Single Player](https://github.com/Encrypted-Thoughts/DidSomeoneSayBingo/wiki/Installation#single-player) 

## Commands
Everything that happens in the mod can be controlled through the commands. For a [list of all of the commands see the wiki page](https://github.com/Encrypted-Thoughts/DidSomeoneSayBingo/wiki/Commands).
